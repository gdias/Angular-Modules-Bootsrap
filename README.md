#Angular modules bootstrap

I change my way of works in front-end development, and i recently make an bootstrap for start instantly an FullJS project. You have an website idea ? Clone project from github and just code it !

I wanted to that AngularJS boilerplate is oriented on modules of browserify instead of the Angular's modules. This approach is a nice way for easy to create an new clientside project with CommonJS modules.

##### Version
> 0.2.1

Into this bootstrap you will find :
##### ServerSide
* Server secured (SSL)
* Api server with JWT Auth routes [Express]
* Email templates helpers [Handlebars]
* Database with Mongoose [MongoDB]

##### ClientSide
* Development Server with Watcher, Compiler and Notifications [Gulp]
* Sass styles Builder [SCSS]
* Angular & Bootstrap
* Units & E2e tests

## Features
- Node 6 Ready
- HTTPS
- Angular 1.5
- API ExpressJS 4
- Database MongoDB
- Json Web Token Authentication
- Module pattern Browserify
- Account part ready (Sign up, Sign In, Password lost)
- Use uglify for validate and compress JS code
- Sass builder (node-sass) and minifying

## Boilerplate
- Basic routes Client (Home, About, Contact)
- Auth module with steps, sign-in, sign-out, forgot password and resend activation email
- API REST protected by JsonWebToken for authentication part

### Before start
Make sure to have an MongoDB server ready for use this bootstrap.
You can use this command for start mongoDB server
> mongod

For the tests E2E with Protractor, make sure you have Java installed and last versions of packages. The last version of NodeJs rewrite package arch, it's preferable to delete all nodes_modules in this case, and only after make
> npm install


#Usage
https://localhost:4443

#### Start local server on secure port 4443
> gulp

#### Start production compression
> gulp prod

#### Start Angular E2e tests
> gulp tests

## Roadmap
- i18n for ML
- E2e & Units tests

## Note
HTTPS : An temporary certificate is available into project, but it's only for development. Change or buy one for your security.

Enjoy !
